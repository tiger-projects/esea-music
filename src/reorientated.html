                <h2>An ESEA Music Survey</h2>
                <p>
                  ESEA Music has now existed for two wonderful years as a
                  community for East and Southeast Asian (“ESEA”) artists
                  and professionals in the UK music industry. In May 2023,
                  we conducted a survey of our members in conjunction with
                  product research and strategy studio <a href="https://www.100kicks.co.uk/"><u>100kicks</u></a>,
                  probing
                  their experiences in the UK music industry in relation
                  to their cultural identity and heritage. Over 80 members
                  participated in the survey, sharing thoughtful and
                  generous reflections. For ESEA Heritage Month, we are
                  pleased to report on a selection of the responses
                  received – on one hand, to empower our members with a
                  view of their responses in the context of the wider
                  community’s collective experiences, and on the other, to
                  help others better understand the unique experiences of
                  the ESEA members of the UK music industry.

                <h2>Why “(Re) Orientated”?
                </h2>
                <p class="font-italic p-0">
                  “From the beginning of Western speculation about the Orient, the one thing the orient could not do was
                  to represent itself. Evidence of the Orient was credible only after it had passed through and been
                  made firm by the refining fire of the Orientalist’s work.”

                </p>
                <p class="font-xs">Edward Said, 2014</p>

                <p>
                  This survey is one of the first of its kind, in that it has collected a representative sample of
                  data
                  on the specific experiences of the ESEA community in the UK music industry, an intersection that has
                  been under-represented and under-reported to date. Being able to conduct this survey at all is
                  uniquely made possible by the existence of ESEA Music as an organisation. We are now able to draw
                  upon
                  our membership to gather meaningful quantitative and qualitative data about our experiences and from
                  this, observe patterns and commonalities, and identify areas where change is needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In sharing these results from our membership survey, ESEA Music invites you to get “(re) orientated”
                  with us. The concept of “orientating”, derives from Orientalism, the academic theory coined by
                  Edward
                  Said. In a nutshell, the theory describes a particular lens through which Asian countries and people
                  have been viewed by Western authors and creators. This “(Re) Orientated” survey invites readers to
                  see
                  our community on our terms, through the voices of ESEA Music and our members.

                        <h3>a) How many British ESEA Artists can you name?
                        </h3>
                        <p>The under-representation of ESEA artists in Britain is self-evident. The biggest ESEA artists
                          in
                          Britain today can be named on one hand, the likes of which include Rina Sawayama, Griff,
                          beabadoobee
                          and Jax Jones. Before ESEA Music was formally established, on the industry side, most of us
                          only
                          knew
                          of a handful of other ESEA music industry professionals and in many cases, we ourselves were
                          the
                          only
                          such people in a room at any given time. It is evident from the responses that representation
                          of
                          ESEA
                          artists in the mainstream, and of ESEA professionals in the industry itself, leaves much to be
                          desired.
                        </p>
                        <p>When asked to rate how well represented they feel in their cultural identity within the UK
                          music
                          industry on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 1 being none and 10 being great representation),
                          respondents
                          gave
                          an average rating of 4.
                        </p>
                        <p>We asked respondents to share their perspectives on ESEA representation within the UK music
                          industry,
                          and have extracted some responses below:

                            show
                            people
                            that WE ARE HERE. I'd love to see more ESEA people in my workplace, more ESEA people in the
                            Official
                            Charts, more ESEA people making the big decisions in big organisations. The rise of K-POP
                            has
                            maybe
                            made people see ESEA musicians as one type of artist, but we need to show everyone that ESEA
                            people
                            are just as multifaceted as everyone else, if not more!”

                            the only big artists from ESEA background that people within the UK know of you can probably
                            count
                            on one hand, as well as in the business industry- there needs to be more focus, celebration,
                            collaboration and education on music from our own heritage and artists to expose to those
                            around
                            us.”

                            to be a
                            pop music artist/ singer- songwriter who had taken a huge chance in studying commercial pop
                            music
                            and then slowly losing confidence because I started to realise that there was literally no
                            Chinese
                            pop artist in British/UK pop music- not even a single person in my entire course (spanning
                            across
                            the 3 years at uni). It changed the whole course of my career, as I instead lost my own
                            courage
                            and
                            started listening to my family who pleaded with me to get a 'normal' and financially stable
                            job.
                            Fast forward to 2021 I landed my new 'dream role' of brand partnerships within one of the
                            big 3
                            major record labels and was so excited until I actually had the worse imposter syndrome due
                            to the
                            lack and pressure of being one of the only Chinese asians in the whole department, that
                            lasted for
                            the entire year of my internship which looking back, definitely hindered a lot of
                            opportunities.
                            This is why I'm so grateful that there is a music community like this for us to lean and
                            learn
                            from
                            one another.”

                            my career, the lack of representation was tough. But it did drive me to work even harder,
                            just to
                            be
                            treated as an 'equal' amongst some of my British colleagues / counterparts. It gave me a

                            'succeed or die' mindset. It was weirdly inspiring, something that I can go back to Hong
                            Kong and
                            think 'wow' I can really do this. If I can do this, then the younger generation of Hong Kong
                            kids
                            can do it too. It's liberating”

                          British
                          music industry?

                        </h3>
                        <p>In the UK, the “Asian” category of cultural identity has typically tended to represent mainly
                          individuals from the South Asian subcontinent. Beyond this, the vast diversity of the Asian
                          continent
                          and its multitude of ethnicities and cultural identities is often consolidated into blanket
                          references
                          to “Asian” (including in the UK government census, which we probed in our survey as set out
                          below),
                          without due regard for the differences between, on a basic level, South Asian and ESEA
                          ethnicities,
                          heritage and cultures. In music, an obvious example is that the state-owned BBC radio station
                          “Asian
                          Network” does not cover music from the ESEA community. Another example was the UK Asian Music
                          Awards,
                          which ran annually from 2002 to 2012, which only featured artists of South Asian heritage.

                        </p>
                        <p>These examples of “invisibilisation” of ESEA people within the “Asian” category in the UK is
                          one
                          likely cause for the lack of ESEA representation in the music industry and beyond. As academic
                          Diana
                          Yeh has observed, “We are ‘visible but unseen’, present in the social and cultural fabric but
                          rendered
                          invisible within the social and cultural imagination.” (Yeh, 2018).</p>
                        <p>When we asked survey respondents to identify their ethnicity or cultural identity from the
                          categories
                          available in the 2021 UK government census, 70% of the respondents were not able to find it.
                          The
                          options available were “Chinese” or “Other Asian”, and where a person is mixed, the closest
                          option
                          available to them is “White and Asian”. It is clear from the responses that “Other Asian” is
                          not
                          inclusive enough of the full range of East and Southeast Asian cultures and ethnicities
                          represented
                          in
                          at least the surveyed population. Respondents shared:

                          The responses reveal an enduring influence of stereotypes that typecast Asian women as exotic
                          and
                          alluring, a phenomenon rooted in colonialism and Orientalism. Hollywood has also played a
                          significant
                          role in perpetuating stereotypes of Asian women as simultaneously submissive and
                          hypersexualised
                          figures. It is clear from the responses that the persistence of these stereotypes negatively
                          impacts

                          perceived by others
                          has had on their career:

                            Asian/Queer EAs could
                            create. People always expect me to be Korean or sing K-Pop. Either that, or people expect me
                            to
                            sing
                            drag queen
                            music. The external view of what I'm allowed to create is very limited. As we are moving
                            forward
                            and
                            gradually
                            getting slightly more representation, and now having groups like the ESEA music group, I
                            feel like
                            we're moving to a
                            stage where it is hopefully becoming a positive perception and allowing new relationships,
                            new
                            understanding from
                            the outside and new appreciation to be fostered. I am really proud of my identity.”</li>

                            worry
                            about it being
                            tokenized
                            at all, it
                            originally felt very cathartic but I can’t tell if it feels conclusive or just more
                            confusing. For
                            this reason, my
                            next record will not be about identity in the same way.”</li>
                          <li class="font-italic">“I think it's had a very big and quiet impact. The feelings are
                            somewhat
                            always the same - you're
                            an
                            outsider
                            looking in but everyone is still nice and diplomatic about it. I try not to dwell on it too
                            much
                            because it won't
                            upset me so I accept that and try to do my best.”</li>
                          <li class="font-italic">“My identity as a musician is deeply entangled with my identity as a
                            Korean
                            woman. All of my music
                            is based upon
                            the challenges and hardships that I faced growing up with immigrant parents.”</li>
                          <li class="font-italic">“It's a big part of it. I'm really cautious approaching music
                            generally
                            because my identity, while
                            celebrated, is
                            still largely stigmatized by society. Sometimes I feel that I don't get acceptance of my
                            music
                            because
                            of my

                            minority.
                            Don't

                          <li class="font-italic">“One noticeable thing is that with my music I've sometimes had my
                            racial
                            identity pasted onto
                            reviews of the music
                            I make seemingly for the sake of it - for example, I remember seeing a review of one of my
                            albums
                            criticize me for
                            something along the lines of 'not using more elements of his Indonesian background in his
                            music',
                            whilst another
                            review of the exact same album praised me for something along the lines of 'including
                            elements of
                            his
                            Indonesian
                            background in his music', despite the fact that as far as I was aware, I hadn't. Both were
                            frustrating
                            as it felt
                            like, by virtue of being half-Indonesian, anything I did was typecast into what my racial
                            identity
                            was
                            - like I was
                            EXPECTED to only create something that had some relation to my race, or else get marked
                            down; on
                            the
                            one hand I felt
                            I was being slagged off for not doing so, on the other hand being supposedly praised for
                            doing so
                            when
                            in my mind
                            the music and themes had nothing to do with my ethnic background.”</li>

                          by
                          ESEA
                          Music, the group
                          is taking steps to improve representation, to create visibility for ESEA people throughout the
                          industry,
                          to support
                          artists in making music that can be connected to their cultural identity, and to make room for
                          the
                          unique experiences of
                          ESEA women, trans and non-binary people.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are a few quotes from our members on what ESEA Music means to them.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li class="font-italic">“I would say that as times are changing, as we are moving forward and
                            gradually getting slightly
                            more
                            representation, and now having groups like the ESEA music group, I feel like we're moving to
                            a
                            stage
                            where it is
                            hopefully becoming a positive perception and allowing new relationships, new understanding
                            from
                            the
                            outside and new
                            appreciation to be fostered. I am really proud of my identity.”</li>
                          <li class="font-italic">“[Representation is] very poor, especially compared to the glimmer of
                            progress
                            seen in the US. But
                            the ESEA music
                            network gives me hope, as it proves that we are present in the music industry and has also
                            helped
                            introduce me to so
                            many new BESEA artists!”</li>
                          <li class="font-italic">“It's still not enough but feels like attentions to ESEA community is
                            getting
                            stronger each
                            year...
                            Even it's a
                            small steps definitely moving forward and ESEA Music is contributing a lot to increase /

                        <p>The formation of ESEA Music presented an opportunity to formally unite a membership of ESEA
                          people
                          working in the UK
                          music industry as artists and professionals, and to collect valuable quantitative and
                          qualitative
                          data
                          from this
                          membership on their experiences in the industry. ESEA Music enlisted the support of product
                          research
                          and strategy studio
                          100kicks to design a methodology for gathering this data.

                          Afreen Saulat (Founder, 100kicks): The co-founder of ESEA Music, Tiger, and I play football
                          together.
                          In early February
                          2020, we were talking about her interest in exploring the opinions and experiences of the ESEA
                          music
                          community. She was
                          adamant that this should not be just another “diversity” survey, but something that accurately
                          reflects the reality of
                          those involved. We devised the following approach:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>
                            - Question mapping: We spent a bit of time collating the ESEA teams questions and started to
                            map
                            them
                            according to
                            essential questions vs. nice to know questions. We collected hypotheses and ensured that we
                            were
                            aligned on what we
                            wanted this piece of work to achieve. 100kicks then went away and designed a draft version
                            of the
                            questions.
                          <li>
                            - Collaborative feedback: Once we had our questions, we got a group of folks from the ESEA
                            community
                            to
                            give us feedback
                            and to ensure that there was no bias and that our questions were framed sensitively.
                            100kicks took
                            this feedback on
                            board and made any additional adjustments.
                          </li>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            - Launching the survey: We used Typeform and informed participants at the start of the
                            survey
                            that
                            it
                            was something that
                            would require them to be in a quiet space to allow for reflection. In order to help them
                            relax we
                            also
                            recommended a
                            calming playlist and a meditation before they began.
                          </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          Finally, we silent a good amount of time in analysis and it's been a true team effort to gauge
                          and
                          allow
                          for colorful
                          insights to come up. The ESEA community is very engaged and we wanted to ensure that the
                          survey was
                          designed in a way
                          that showcases this.</p>
